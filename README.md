# Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table

DrivenData has begun a competition ['Pump It Up'](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/) to point the Tanzanian clean water problem. In our module 3 project, we worked on this data science competition.

**Problem:**

Tanzania is the largest country of East-Africa with 59,353,795 population according to [worldometers.info](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/tanzania-population/). 25 million of this population have lack access to clean water, 40 million people also have a lack access to improved sanitation. Water is a basic need and for human beings. The Tanzanian Water Ministry agreeed with Taarifa and they aimed to solve this problem improving clean water sources. There are many water wells which already established, but some of them are non-functional or needs repair.

**Aim:**
Our goal in this project is to build a model which predicts the functionality of water points. With this predictive model, authorities can understand which water points are functional, nonfunctional and functional but it needs to repair. This model can help the Tanzanian government to find likely maintenance needy wells or give an useful information for future wells. With this model, we can help to the Tanzanian authorities how to use water sources as a productive way. It also helps the investment of the government on wells.

**Solution:**

With the 86% accuracy, our model can predict the functionality of wells. With the good prediction of functionality, the solutions can be; 

 - prioritizing functioning wells which need repair and yield clean water
 - targeting repairs to clusters of wells especially those with high populations
 - payments of some kind will provide incentive to keep wells functional
 - allocate funds and resources to effective organizations with track record

**Data:** (state challanges of steps)

The original data was obtained from the [DrivenData 'Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table'](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/) competition. Basically, there are 4 different data sets; submission format, training set, test set and train labels set which contains status of wells. With given training set and labels set, competitors are wanted to build predictive model and apply it to test set to determine status of the wells and submit.

In this project, we used train set and train label set which have 59400 water points data with 40 features.
