# Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table

DrivenData has begun a competition ['Pump It Up'](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/) to point the Tanzanian clean water problem. In our module 3 project, we worked on this data science competition.

## Problem:

Tanzania is the largest country of East-Africa with 59,353,795 population according to [worldometers.info](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/tanzania-population/). 25 million of this population have lack access to clean water, 40 million people also have a lack access to improved sanitation. Water is a basic need and for human beings. The Tanzanian Water Ministry agreeed with Taarifa and they aimed to solve this problem improving clean water sources. There are many water wells which already established, but some of them are non-functional or needs repair.

## Aim :
Our goal in this project is to build a model which predicts the functionality of water points. With this predictive model, authorities can understand which water points are functional, nonfunctional and functional but it needs to repair. This model can help the Tanzanian government to find likely maintenance needy wells or give an useful information for future wells. With this model, we can help to the Tanzanian authorities how to use water sources as a productive way. It also helps the investment of the government on wells.

## Solution:
